To test the LRU Cache implementation, simply open a terminal, navigate to the directory with cache.py and run:
python3 cache.py

Follow the prompts to initialize the cache with a maximum capacity (must be an integer) and then test out the available methods.
The contents of the cache will also be printed on the screen after each method.
